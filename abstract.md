Jasmine Abstract

So you've decided to test your JavaScript. Have you decided how? Would you like a framework that has a BDD syntax so you can express your specs cleanly? How about a one that is free of dependencies on application frameworks? Or, if you're working on server-side JS, one that doesn't require a DOM?

Welcome to Jasmine - a Behavior-Driven Development testing framework for JavaScript that is as comfortable testing code for a Ruby on Rails app as it is an embeddable widget or a Node.js server. We'll fly by the syntax, sane source management, and touch on advanced topics such as dealing with AJAX calls and shared example groups.
